NAME="perl-File-Remove"
VERSION=1.52
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Perl"
SUMMARY="Perl module for removing files and directories"
DESCRIPTION="File::Remove::remove removes files and directories. It acts like
/bin/rm, for the most part. Although 'unlink' can be given a list of files, it
will not remove directories; this module remedies that. It also accepts
wildcards as arguments for filenames."
